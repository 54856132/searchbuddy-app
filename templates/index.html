            <h2>What is SearchBuddy?</h2>
            <p>
                Ever had a lyric stuck in your head but couldn't remember the song? SearchBuddy helps you find songs based on lyrics.
                Just type in a line or phrase from any song, and we'll return the closest match using advanced search systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                We intelligently guess the most likely track—even if the lyrics are vague or incomplete.
                It works best with popular songs, but we're constantly improving accuracy for all genres and regions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an experimental tool. Some matches may be approximate or incorrect—especially for lesser-known tracks. Your feedback helps us improve!</p>
